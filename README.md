### BACKGROUND

**Video conferencing** is an essential part of our daily work. Either working with colleagues internally or meeting with clients and partners.

But sometimes there's a common wording over and over again. So we created this **simple fun app** to enjoy video conferencing even more. ðŸ¤“

A list of common phrases like: "**Sorry, I couldn't log in**" or "**I had connection issues**" are placed randomly on a standard bingo card.
If you never played bingo before â€“ what?? ðŸ¤¯ â€“Â [**here**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_(American_version)>) are the basic rules.

**The most important rules in our version:**

- A player wins by completing a row, column, or diagonal.
- There's a free slot (always on) in the middle
- There are **multiple** bingos possible

### THE CHALLENGE

**Must haves:**

- Build a fully working Bingo App using ReactJS **respecting the 3 basic rules explained above**.
- The game **must** always fit nicely to any screen-size (e.g. mobile).
- **Design your own version** â€“Â our game is an **example**. Be creative and pick your **own design**!
- Having a bingo requires a **nice visual reward**. You don't need to use confetti â€“Â choose something you believe fits best.
- Ensure that several players opening the URL on their own device at the same time have the equal chance of winning
- **Choose your own topic** â€“ but think of a logical use case for playing it and tell us your use case.

### TOOLS & TIME

- You should use ReactJS (latest version) â€“Â the rest is up to you!
  If you want to use whatever CSS / JS Libraries etc. Do it â€“Â but explain why.
- The challenge should not take longer than 4 hours.

### SUBMITTING / QUESTIONS

The working challenge code should be submitted online and also deployed to a public accessible URL.
